## Welcome to my homepage

I am a first year Materials DPhil student studying dislocation dynamics at the University of Oxford.
Last year I did the MSc in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics. [Here's](https://dhortela.github.io/pdfs/thesis_04_10_2019.pdf) my dissertation for that course.
And [here's](https://dhortela.github.io/pdfs/CV_24_07_2019_Daniel_Hortelano_Roig.pdf) my CV.
